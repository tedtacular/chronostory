I've figured out how to create the game without implementing the advanced features yet.
Mainly it's just the functions that allow progress through the story by going section to section.
I'm currently populating the sections with their challenges. 

Stuff I'm still trying to figure out:
1. effectively storing variables when someone has finished a playthrough so they can access the final rooms
2. local storage
3. making it so that people can hit enter on the keyboard instead of clicking when inputting passwords without breaking the game

I can create a working model without these advanced features to show in class on Tuesday.
